# openwine.co.il
E-commerce store for my sister buisness. 
I used Python/django engine and the main purpose was to nuild self-made back-end solution. 
I took core from @CodingMedved engine and made my own improvments and additions.
Actually the main chalange was with the front-end(javascript).
Site is totaly workable but in the end we took WIX solution.
